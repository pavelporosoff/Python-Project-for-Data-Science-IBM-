# Python-Project-for-Data-Science-IBM-
This is a final assignment from one of the IBM courses on Data Science via Coursera. This mini-course is intended to demonstrate foundational Python skills for working with data by developing a simple dashboard using Python.

# Project Description by IBM: 
For this project, you will assume the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. Your job is to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data you will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks we will work with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.
